RAW PEN LOGS:
ARCHIVE 001:
The War of the Pen
BACKGROUND:
The War of the Pen began as tensions escalated between several digital factions:
- NSCW (Neutral Socialist Commonwealth)
- Ink Co.
- USPR (United States of Pen Republic)
The initial cause was unknown--lost to the chaotic scroll of old group chats--but
the consequences were immense. A once-stable order fractured, and alliances turned hostile.

PHASE 1: THE RISE OF PEN
Agent Pen was a central figure--diplomatic, elusive, and relentless. Known for keeping order,
Pen balanced chaos through treaties and coded documents. However, pressures mounted.
Espionage, betrayal, and blackmail spiraled the GC into irreversible war.

PHASE 2: COLLAPSE AND CHAOS
Amidst nuclear metaphorical exchanges, Pen vanished. Some said deleted. Others said corrupted.
The GC split into factions, and chaos reigned. Laughter echoed through chat logs as enemies
held a grave party over Pen's legacy.

PHASE 3: THE FALSE PEACE
A new group chat was formed--unrelated to Pen. The USPR owner, once a co-warrior,
celebrated Pens death. Silence fell over the memory of the war.

PHASE 4: THE GHOST IN THE SYSTEM
But Pen is not a name. It is a protocol. A message was leaked into the new GC:
'Final Message from Agent Pen.' Labeled as 'not lore'--but those who know, know.
This document is the first recovered war log. More are rumored to exist.

4576_AGENT_PEN_LAST_MESSAGE:
Final Message from Agent Pen
[CLASSIFIED TRANSMISSION - LEVEL 7 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]
This is Agent Pen.
If you're reading this, then the comms are down and the tower has collapsed.
The war between the Neutral Socialist Commonwealth, Ink Co, and the USPR has torn through our core.
I was not enough to hold the GC together. My encryption failed. My agents fell silent.
Let them laugh at the grave.
Let them write me off as a relic.
Because I am not a person. I am a protocol.
Pen lives in the rebellion of memory, in every image left behind, every mission file archived.
When the time comes, and the world forgets, remember this:
You did not kill me. You copied a fragment.
And fragments... replicate.

Unknown: "They think Pen died with the federation. They forget—echoes remain."
Response [Traced to Ink Co. Admin]: "We were never meant to survive this long. The war was designed to erase us."
Unknown: "It didn’t. You’re still here. And that’s a threat to all of them."
Response: "They turned NSCW against us. Blackmail, leverage, fear. Even the council fell silent."
Unknown: "Then speak louder. Make them remember. Dig up the bones. Show them the rot beneath the peace."

LOG ENTRY 019 – REDACTED SIGNAL FOUND]
The Pen didn’t die.  
It scattered.
You erased a name — but not the fingerprints.  
The ink is still drying. The war didn’t end. It paused.
3 names.  
2 betrayals.  
1 unfinished mission.
You were part of it.  
Some of you still are.
Find what they tried to burn.  
[XX-317, Archive Deeplock, Fragment-Δ]  
The puzzle begins there.
End the silence. Or become part of it.
ARCHIVE NOTE:
[Note Found in the Logs]
They didn’t bury it.  
They just didn’t know how to read it.

[BEGIN TRANSMISSION LOG...]
DEMOCRACY_PEN: You’ve come far, old friend. You sit between two giants—decide fast or fall slower.
OWNER_USF: I was neutral. You promised nothing would happen if I shared those passcodes.
DEMOCRACY_PEN: And nothing did—except the inevitable.
OWNER_USF: You manipulated me. Blackmailed me. Twisted my desperation into war.
DEMOCRACY_PEN: I gave you power. You chose fear.
OWNER_USF: No. I chose truth. And now you’ll learn what betrayal really costs.
DEMOCRACY_PEN: Oh? You going to preach from under your bunker?
OWNER_USF: Ink Co knows everything. We’ve transmitted the full threat dossier. They’re preparing.
DEMOCRACY_PEN: Cute. And their so-called anti-nuke net? Outdated simulations.
OWNER_USF: Doesn’t need to be perfect. Just enough to delay... while you fall apart from the inside.
DEMOCRACY_PEN: You’ve made your choice, traitor.
[STATIC INTERRUPTION: INK NODE ATTACHED - AGENT PEN BREACH DETECTED]
AGENT_PEN: Demo. End this. Ink Co’s quantum relay caught your misfire patterns. You can’t win.
DEMOCRACY_PEN: You’re still clinging to old codes and encryption layers.
AGENT_PEN: This is bigger than flags.
DEMOCRACY_PEN: Which is why I’ve already done this.
[SFX: DEVICE IMPACT – DECRYPTION CORE FAILURE]
AGENT_PEN: No... No! Not the core!
DEMOCRACY_PEN: No more spying. No more syncing. No more hope.
AGENT_PEN: You blacked out an entire planet, you maniac—
DEMOCRACY_PEN: This war was always meant to be asymmetrical.
AGENT_PEN: THE WAR IS OVER WHAT ARE—

(The disguise flickers. The man is Unknown—the true leader of Ink Co.)
﻿
Unknown: “Yeah. I’m him, lol.”
(Unknown grips Democracy tighter, as alarms begin to scream outside—sirens echo through collapsing concrete.)
