RAW PEN LOGS:
ARCHIVE 001:
The War of the Pen
BACKGROUND:
The War of the Pen began as tensions escalated between several digital factions:
- NSCW (Neutral Socialist Commonwealth)
- Ink Co.
- USPR (United States of Pen Republic)
The initial cause was unknown--lost to the chaotic scroll of old group chats--but
the consequences were immense. A once-stable order fractured, and alliances turned hostile.

PHASE 1: THE RISE OF PEN
Agent Pen was a central figure--diplomatic, elusive, and relentless. Known for keeping order,
Pen balanced chaos through treaties and coded documents. However, pressures mounted.
Espionage, betrayal, and blackmail spiraled the GC into irreversible war.

PHASE 2: COLLAPSE AND CHAOS
Amidst nuclear metaphorical exchanges, Pen vanished. Some said deleted. Others said corrupted.
The GC split into factions, and chaos reigned. Laughter echoed through chat logs as enemies
held a grave party over Pen's legacy.

PHASE 3: THE FALSE PEACE
A new group chat was formed--unrelated to Pen. The USPR owner, once a co-warrior,
celebrated Pens death. Silence fell over the memory of the war.

PHASE 4: THE GHOST IN THE SYSTEM
But Pen is not a name. It is a protocol. A message was leaked into the new GC:
'Final Message from Agent Pen.' Labeled as 'not lore'--but those who know, know.
This document is the first recovered war log. More are rumored to exist.

4576_AGENT_PEN_LAST_MESSAGE:
Final Message from Agent Pen
[CLASSIFIED TRANSMISSION - LEVEL 7 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]
This is Agent Pen.
If you're reading this, then the comms are down and the tower has collapsed.
The war between the Neutral Socialist Commonwealth, Ink Co, and the USPR has torn through our core.
I was not enough to hold the GC together. My encryption failed. My agents fell silent.
Let them laugh at the grave.
Let them write me off as a relic.
Because I am not a person. I am a protocol.
Pen lives in the rebellion of memory, in every image left behind, every mission file archived.
When the time comes, and the world forgets, remember this:
You did not kill me. You copied a fragment.
And fragments... replicate.
